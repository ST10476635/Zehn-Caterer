Whole CSS framework

I used purple tones as the main brand colors in a unified color scheme, with gold serving as an accent color and black (#333) for typography.  This color scheme was picked to preserve readability and visual balance while showcasing the business's stylish and high-end catering offerings.To guarantee easy reading and a logical flow of material, every piece was properly styled with the proper padding, margins, and line heights.  In order to improve user engagement and give visual feedback, I also added hover effects and smooth transitions throughout the interface, making it more engaging for website visitors.

Navigation Bar

I decided to use a backdrop image with a purple overlay for the navigation system.  Through careful contrast management, this design decision maintains optimal readability while also adding visual interest to the navigation section and reinforcing the brand's association with food and catering through pictures.  In keeping with current web design trends, the implementation employs a backdrop blur effect behind the navigation links to create a clean, glass-like appearance.  The connections' semi-transparent backgrounds preserve the overall visual coherence while guaranteeing that they are easily observable against a variety of background images.

Responsive Design Framework

I put in place a thorough responsive design system with several breakpoints because I understood how important mobile accessibility is.  The navigation changes from a horizontal style to a vertical column-based structure for tablet devices (768px and below), guaranteeing touch-friendly interaction.  In order to maximize the restricted screen space while preserving readability, font sizes and padding are suitably lowered.

 Additional improvements were made for mobile devices (480px and below), such as full-width buttons for simpler tapping, a smaller logo in a circular style of 100px, and rearranged spacing to optimize content display.  In order to guarantee that they scale correctly across various viewport sizes without sacrificing usability or aesthetic appeal, all images, iframes, and form components were made flexible.

 PAGES CHANGES

 Homepage 
 Since the homepage is the main place where visitors land, it was given particular consideration.  In order to successfully convey the company's main messages, I used a centered layout with an enhanced typographic hierarchy.  Subtle shadows and rounded corners were added to images to give them a polished look and visual depth.  In order to establish credibility and trust with prospective customers, testimonials were styled with more importance.

 About Page Structure
 To establish a clear content hierarchy, the About page was reorganized using color-coded headings.  Team member images were arranged with uniform dimensions and spacing, and mission and vision statements were presented with unique styling to highlight their significance.  Visual coherence with the overall brand design is achieved by using gold accents for underlined headings.

 Services Page
 Users could easily compare options and comprehend the breadth of offerings because service categories were clearly defined and styled consistently.  Strategic use of color was used to draw attention to the pricing information, and the Google Form that was incorporated was designed to blend in with the website's design while still being useful.

 Technical changes
 The design of the CSS framework focused scalability and maintainability.  I developed base styles for small displays and improved them for larger viewports using a mobile-first approach.  The operation of the website was not affected because all of the current HTML IDs were kept and styled correctly.  The code follows to standard practices for CSS organization and contains thorough comments for future maintenance.
